### stuff about me
im mostly people watching/afk since im too nervous to speak to anyone. find me at bread lines, library, i move a lot
i do cosplays of my fav characters. sometimes im not even in the fandom anymore (GI)

c+h is welcomed and highly encouraged. im not putting it in my pony name nuh uh

since i do infact have a life, im mostly semi-active and offtab. i play on my freetime as a time waster, i dont respond to whispers often/VERY late

im not too big on shipping, but i respect those who ship. just dont force it onto me... 

i am so. so bad at small talk. like genuinely. i can listen but not talk


### i like these (fandoms, stuff i like doing, youtubers,,, blaj blah blah you get it)
hsr, hi3, mcyt(specifically hermitcrafters), plan3, magic the noah, playing, people watching, uhhh idk.... whoops

### i dont like these (DNI)

shipping me with people(be it in cosplay or not, NO.), dni criteria, sexual themes, hazbin hotel & every other problematic fandom
###### (ps: yes, i ignore most of these, but i will block and hide freely)

im free to interact with anybody, other than the "i dont like these" listed down. i genuinely enjoy company, but i just lack the words to express it
